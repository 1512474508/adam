    New pileup command that creates a reference-ordered data file sorted
    by position with the reference base and pileup (including phred scores)
    at each position

  IMPROVEMENTS

    The print command is simplified and no longer launches a map-reduce job.
    Contents of files are now immediately streamed to console.

    Added the unique record group identifier to ADAM read records

  BUG FIXES

    Fixed the read file format to use 0-based (instead of 1-based) offsets
    for read positions. All ADAM files are 0-based.
